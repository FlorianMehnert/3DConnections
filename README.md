# ![nodegraph](./images/3DConnections.png)
This is a Unity Extension used to primarily visualize and analyze scenes in Unity.

# Installation
- in the unity package manager add this package via git: https://github.com/FlorianMehnert/3DConnections.git
- when extension is installed go to `Tools/3DConnections/` and execute the following:
  - Copy and Add Overlay Scene
  - Add OverlayScene Layer
- In a scene you want to analyze open the context menu (right click) in the Hierarchy: `3DConnections/Add Entrypoint`
- You might also want to change the render pipeline in `Edit/Project Settings` under Graphics to the Universal Render Pipeline Asset (not 2D) for bloom

## GUIBuilder
- execute all Button GUI Methods to ensure proper placement of UI Elements

## ClassParser & ClassReferences
- see SceneConnections

## SceneHandler
- mainly to add another Scene which is loaded in Addivite mode (overlaying the existing scenes)

## NodeBuilder
- Handle the creation and composition of the nodes later used to display dependencies

## 30.November
- add layer to which I can render stuff that only appears in display 2
  - requires camera in OverlayScene ("NewScene" currently) that renders **orthographically** to **display 2**
  - add new layer in Edit > Project Settings > Tags and Layers â†’ new layer DisplayOverlay
  - select the game object
  - assign the cube to the DisplayOverlay layer in the _Inspector_
  - go to the Culling Mask property in the _Inspector_
  ### Configure Cameras to visualize (everything except) the overlay layer
  1. add a new layer: Edit > Project Settings > Tags and Layers â†’ e.g., DisplayOverlay
  2. assuming the project structure looks as follows: camera 1 is in the original scene rendering something you want to visualize using the 3DConnections addon -> select the camera in the OverlayScene (camera2) and only enable the new Scene in the OcclusionLayer setting in the inspektor
  3. disable the new layer in cam1 (original scene)
  ```csharp
  public string display2LayerName = "Display2Only"; // Layer name to use
  int display2Layer = LayerMask.NameToLayer(display2LayerName); // get the layer index for the specified layer name
  
  public Camera display2Camera;
  display2Camera.cullingMask = 1 << display2Layer; // Set culling mask to include only the layer```
  
  Camera mainCamera = Camera.main;
  mainCamera.cullingMask &= ~(1 << display2Layer); // Eclude the culling mask layer from the main camera
  
## 1.December
- trying to switch between displays in the Editor

## 10.December
- trying out roslyn to parse classes
- install using NuGet (which is installed using the git url)
```bash
https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity.git?path=/src/NuGetForUnity
```
